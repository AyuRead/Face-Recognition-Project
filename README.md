# Attendance tracking system using Face Recognition  

Greetings everyone! 
We all have noticed that in the school around 10 to 15 minutes are wasted in taking the attendance by the teachers well those 15 minutes could be used for clearing doubts of some student. Not to worry now as I have made a system that will track your attendance by just recognizing your face and for that a good knowledge of Machine Learning is required and I have used Python Language, OpenCV technology and various other libraries like datetime, Numpy, Face Recognition and many others. For this I have made a folder which stores the images of all the students of the class.
